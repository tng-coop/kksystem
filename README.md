Review your 24-month capital growth and member distribution at a glance. The data initializes automatically in Demo Mode using pseudo-random generation to simulate a living cooperative environment.

### 2. Member Management
Register new members and click any row to instantly expand their full lifetime contribution history directly inside the interactive grid.

### 3. Recording Capital
Log new financial contributions securely. The software automatically attributes deposits cleanly directly to your active member profile database and recalculates the global dashboard charts in real-time.

### 4. Printing Certificates
Deploy the native browser print engine by clicking the **Print Labels** or **Print Certificate** button. The application dynamically purges UI headers, disables dark mode (`@media print`), and generates perfectly scaled mailing labels and officially formatted desktop capital certificates effortlessly.
